# Visual system

The site's identity comes from how it teaches beginners. Typography supports
that structure. Decoration cannot make a generic arrangement distinctive.

## 0. Layout follows the reader's task

- The course index is a numbered syllabus. Keep its order visible, including
  when search narrows the list. A lesson row shows its title, full useful
  description, reading time, and completion state. Do not render the syllabus
  as a grid of equal marketing cards.
- Give the guide index a compact heading and one search field. Align them in
  the same row on wide screens; on phones the field uses the available width.
  Search matches guide copy and translated topic names. Keep the first lesson
  in the syllabus rather than repeating it in a hero callout. Topic chips and
  platform comparisons do not belong on the course index. Section headings
  carry the level name and meaningful completion state without generic slogans.
- Keep the syllabus text-led. Do not add a thumbnail to every lesson. Use an
  image only when it identifies a real app, shows a real interface, or explains
  a step that text alone makes difficult to picture.
- The progress page follows the same lesson order and row structure, so the
  course does not change shape when a reader checks what is complete.
- An introduction, a comparison, a course outline, and a tool have different
  jobs. Give them different layouts. A centered heading followed by equal
  cards is not the default page template.
- Review connected pages in reading order. The home page explains the problem
  and offers a first step, the course index shows the complete route, and each
  guide teaches one part of it. Check the destination of each call to action:
  repeating the same promise or featuring the first guide again breaks the
  transition even when both pages look good separately.
- Give each section boundary one visible rule. Check the rendered result when a
  section border meets the first list item's border; stacked rules look like an
  accidental double divider.
- Do not put a card inside another card. Use sections and rules to group
  resources and tools. Reserve a bordered panel for a control that needs one.
- Put search near the top of reference pages. Present glossary terms as a
  scannable list instead of equally weighted cards.
- On narrow screens, make the first useful action visible before search and
  filtering controls. Do not spend the first viewport on empty hero space.
- Keep guide prose in a readable column and retain the table of contents for
  long lessons. On phones, place the contents after the title and standfirst;
  on wide screens, keep it beside the article. The article does not need a
  surrounding card to be legible.
- Use concrete examples, annotated client screenshots, and diagrams close to
  the concept they explain. Visuals should help the reader decide or learn.
- On the home page, use three compact scenes with the same purple ostrich and
  its angular lightning-bolt beak: the cabinet beside the introductory problem
  and answer, the two app views beside "What changes on Nostr", and the map
  beside the platform-comparison heading. Their files are in
  `public/illustrations/`. Keep text selectable. Place art beside section
  headings or the whole statement, never in only one row of a parallel list.
  Keep it small enough on narrow screens that links remain easy to reach.
- Keep the home hero's problem, concrete Nostr answer, and course introduction
  in one reading column. On wide screens, the cabinet sits beside the opening
  block. On narrow screens it follows the complete problem and answer, never
  interrupting them. Set the problem as an editorial lead, keep the consequence
  quieter, and reserve the purple rule for the Nostr answer. Do not enclose all
  three statements in the same callout.
- Use "What changes on Nostr" to expand the answer in three plain-language
  points. Its section divider is enough; do not add another rule above the
  first point. Then show the first four guides as full-width numbered rows. Keep
  platform comparisons optional and do not assume every beginner is leaving
  another platform. The course index holds the complete three-level outline;
  do not repeat it in a separate home-page section.
- In a lesson, separate comparisons and quiz answers with rules and spacing.
  Avoid nesting bordered panels. A quiz result needs clear feedback, not an
  animated reveal.
- Mark a lesson as read only after the reader chooses that action or finishes
  its quiz. Scroll depth and time on page can show position or engagement but
  cannot award completion.
- The footer may repeat the logo as a site signature. Keep the description
  concrete and short; explain browser key generation next to the key tool,
  where a reader needs that assurance.

The rules below still govern color, type, spacing, and ornament.

## 1. The display face: Fraunces

Fraunces Variable, weight axis 100–900, SIL OFL 1.1, by Undercase Type.
Self-hosted at `public/fonts/`, because the site's own CSP is `font-src 'self'`
and Google Fonts is therefore blocked by policy, not by preference.

**Why this one.** It is a display serif built out of mid-century advertising
type, and it was drawn with an argument: that a screen face is allowed to have
warmth and a little wobble instead of the ironed-out neutrality everything else
has settled on. That fits a patient teaching site for people new to Nostr
better than another grotesque would. It also does the practical job — at 700
weight it has real presence at heading sizes, and next to a plain system sans
it makes the page look composed rather than decorated. Inter and Space Grotesk
were excluded on purpose: they are what a page picks when nobody chose.

**Where it is used.** Headings only. `h1`–`h4` globally (`src/styles/globals.css`),
`.prose` headings, and anything an applier tags `font-display`. Never body
text, never labels, never buttons, never code.

**How it is gated.** Two independent gates, both already wired:

1. `Layout.astro` sets `data-display-face="fraunces"` on `<html>` only when
   `usesDisplayFace(locale)` is true — that is, `script === 'latin'` in
   `src/config/locales.ts`. That attribute is what repoints `--font-display`.
   On zh, ar and hi the variable stays at the system stack, the `@font-face`
   rule is never referenced, and an unreferenced `@font-face` downloads
   nothing. Those scripts render better in the reader's own system font than
   in anything we would ship anyway.
2. `unicode-range` on each `@font-face`, so even a stray Latin string on a
   Chinese page can only ever pull the Latin subset, never Han.

**The two files.**

| file | bytes | covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fraunces-latin-wght-normal.woff2` | 36.6 KB | ASCII + Latin-1: Spanish `ñ á é í ó ú ü`, German `ä ö ü ß`, curly quotes, dashes |
| `fraunces-latin-ext-wght-normal.woff2` | 33.6 KB | Latin Extended-A: Polish `ą ć ę ł ń ś ź ż` |

Glyph coverage was verified against the actual font tables with fontTools, not
against the declared `unicode-range`. Spanish and German need only the first
file — every accent they use sits inside U+00C0–U+00FF. Polish is the only
locale that needs the second, which is why `localeConfig.latinExtended` is
`true` for `pl` alone and only `pl` preloads it.

**Loading.** `font-display: swap`, preload with `crossorigin` (required even
same-origin, or the browser fetches twice), and the `@font-face` rules live in
the inline critical CSS in `Layout.astro` rather than in the bundled stylesheet
so the request starts on the first bytes of the head. Nothing here blocks
rendering. The July 2026 audit removed render-blocking Google Fonts; do not put
them back.

**If you replace the face**, the OFL requires the licence file to travel with
it. `public/fonts/Fraunces-LICENSE.txt` ships alongside.

## 2. Body text: the system stack, deliberately

No webfont for body copy. `tailwind.config.js` `fontFamily.sans` is a real
system stack ending in `sans-serif` plus the emoji faces.

This is a decision, not an omission. It costs zero bytes, it renders all seven
scripts correctly on every platform without a per-script font programme, and it
is the only stack that will look native to an Arabic or Devanagari reader.
Inter — which the config used to name and which `Layout.astro` really did load,
four weights of it via `@fontsource` — was the most-defaulted UI face on the
web. Dropping it is what pays for the display face. `@fontsource/inter` has
been removed from `package.json`; do not reintroduce it.

## 3. The type scale

Named steps in `tailwind.config.js` `fontSize`. **Each step carries its own
line height and letter spacing.** Use the name; do not bolt a `leading-*` or
`tracking-*` on top, and never write an arbitrary size.

| class | size | line height | tracking | use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text-display` | `clamp(2.5rem, 6vw, 3.75rem)` | 1.05 | −0.022em | hero h1, one per page at most |
| `text-h1` | 2.25rem | 1.12 | −0.02em | page title |
| `text-h2` | 1.75rem | 1.22 | −0.015em | section |
| `text-h3` | 1.3125rem | 1.32 | −0.01em | subsection, card title |
| `text-h4` | 1.0625rem | 1.45 | −0.005em | small heading |
| `text-lead` | 1.1875rem | 1.6 | 0 | standfirst under a heading. Sans, not display |
| `text-body` | 1.0625rem | 1.7 | 0 | running text |
| `text-body-sm` | 0.9375rem | 1.6 | 0 | secondary text, helper copy |
| `text-caption` | 0.8125rem | 1.5 | 0.005em | metadata, timestamps |
| `text-micro` | 0.6875rem | 1.4 | 0.07em | eyebrows and labels; always with `uppercase` |

`text-display` is a `clamp()`, so it needs no responsive prefixes. Do not write
`text-4xl md:text-6xl` alongside it.

Body is 17px, not 16. System UI faces run small next to a display serif and the
page reads thin at 16.

**Measure.** Running text gets `max-w-measure` (65ch). `max-w-measure-narrow`
(52ch) for a pull quote or a narrow aside, `max-w-measure-wide` (74ch) when a
block genuinely needs the room. Nothing sets a measure in `px`.

The old numeric utilities (`text-sm` … `text-4xl`) still exist and still
compile — the existing components are full of them. Anything you rewrite moves
to the names above.

## 4. Ornament rules

Mechanical. Apply them without asking.

### Gradients — all 130 go

| you find | you write |
| --- | --- |
| gradient section background | nothing, or a flat band: `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900` |
| gradient hero | page ground, no class. Separate it with `border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800` if it needs an edge |
| gradient card | see the card recipe below |
| gradient button | `bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white` |
| gradient progress bar | `bg-primary-600` |
| gradient border / ring | `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800` |

A page may use **at most one** flat band. Two bands in a row is stripes, which
is the same disease with the saturation turned down.

### Gradient text — all 19 go

`bg-gradient-to-r … bg-clip-text text-transparent` becomes
`text-gray-900 dark:text-white`. That is the whole rule.

If a heading truly needs emphasis, set **one word** in
`text-primary-text dark:text-primary-400`. Not a phrase, not the verb and the
noun. One word, and most headings do not need even that.

### Cards

```
rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white dark:border-gray-800 dark:bg-gray-900
```

Interactive card, add:

```
transition-colors hover:border-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-50
dark:hover:border-gray-700 dark:hover:bg-gray-800
```

Muted / secondary card: swap the ground to `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900`.

Pastel tinted card (the 29): the tint goes. A card is a border and a ground.
The only exception is a card whose tint is **semantic** — a warning callout, an
error state — and those follow §5's semantic rule, not this one.

A card does not float, so it gets no shadow. `shadow-card` exists
(`0 1px 2px rgb(15 23 42 / 0.04)`) for the rare place a hairline of separation
genuinely helps on white; it is invisible on the dark ground, which is why
every recipe above carries a `dark:` border.

### Radius

| was | is |
| --- | --- |
| `rounded-3xl`, `rounded-2xl`, `rounded-xl` on cards, panels, modals, sections | `rounded-lg` |
| buttons, inputs, selects, small chips | `rounded-md` |
| avatars, status dots, true pills, icon-only round buttons | `rounded-full` — unchanged |

Nothing above `rounded-lg` survives on a rectangle.

### Shadows — 155 of them

`shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`, `shadow-2xl`, `hover:shadow-*` on anything sitting in
the flow of a page: delete, and make sure the element has the border from the
card recipe.

`shadow-raised` (`0 8px 24px -8px rgb(15 23 42 / 0.18)`) is for things that
genuinely sit above the page and would be ambiguous flat: modals, dropdowns,
popovers, the mobile nav sheet. That is the complete list.

### hover:scale — all 43 go

Replace with a colour change: `transition-colors` plus the hover border/ground
from the card recipe, or `hover:bg-primary-700` on a button. Links get
`underline underline-offset-2`.

No `transition-transform`, no `hover:-translate-y-*`, no `active:scale-*`. If
some motion survives elsewhere it must carry `motion-reduce:transform-none`,
but the point is that after this pass there is nothing left to guard.

### backdrop-blur — all 19 go

Including the sticky header, which becomes opaque:

```
bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800
```

No `bg-white/70`, no `dark:bg-gray-900/50` (that one is a standing house rule
— it renders a muddy brown).

### Accent versus semantic colour

Colour discipline on this site is already good. Keep it that way.

**Purple (`primary`)** means *you can act on this*: links, primary buttons,
focus rings, the active nav item, a selected filter, a progress fill, at most
one emphasised word in a heading. It is never a decorative fill for a section
and never a mood.

Text purple on a light ground is `text-primary-text` (`#7C3AED`, AA at 5.70:1),
`text-primary-400` on dark. `text-primary-500` fails AA as body text on white
— do not use it for text.

**Green / amber / red** stay strictly semantic: success, warning, error/danger.
A green card means something succeeded. If nothing succeeded, the card is not
green.

`friendly-gold`, `friendly-warm-*` and `friendly-cream` are ornament colours.
Do not reach for them in new work.

### Focus

`Layout.astro` carries a global `:focus-visible` outline — purple-600 on light,
purple-300 on dark. It is the safety net under this whole pass: when you strip
a decorative `ring-*` class the focus ring must not go with it. If you remove a
focus affordance from a component and the global outline does not obviously
replace it, put a better one back before you move on.

## 5. Icons

`lucide-react` is already in 71 components. It is the icon system; there is no
second one.

**Defaults.** `strokeWidth={1.5}` always. Size by role:

| role | class |
| --- | --- |
| inline with a line of text | `h-4 w-4` |
| beside a heading, in a button, in a list row | `h-5 w-5` |
| feature block, empty state | `h-6 w-6` |

Never larger than `h-6 w-6`. A big icon is ornament wearing a uniform.

**Colour.** Decorative: `text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500`. Marking something
interactive or branded: `text-primary-text dark:text-primary-400`. Marking a
state: the semantic colour, e.g. `text-warning-600 dark:text-warning-400`.
Never a gradient, never a coloured circular badge behind it.

### Emoji

Sort every emoji into one of two piles.

**Decorative** — it repeats what the words already say, or it is there for
warmth. The 13 on the homepage, the 203 in guide headings. **Delete it.** Do
not swap in an icon. A heading that reads `🔑 Your keys` becomes `Your keys`;
the word "keys" was already doing the work, and one heading in Fraunces is
worth more than an emoji in front of it.

**Meaningful** — remove it and the reader loses information. A ⚠️ that marks a
step where you can lose your account. A ✅ / ❌ that is the answer to a quiz. A
🔒 that means encrypted, a 🔑 that means this is the key material. **Becomes a
lucide icon plus a translated text label**, never a bare icon:

```tsx
<span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 text-warning-700 dark:text-warning-400">
  <AlertTriangle className="h-4 w-4 shrink-0" strokeWidth={1.5} aria-hidden="true" />
  <span>{t('common.warning')}</span>
</span>
```

`aria-hidden="true"` on every icon, decorative or not — the text next to it is
what a screen reader should read. An icon that is the whole control (an
icon-only button) needs `aria-label={t(...)}` on the button instead.

The label is a `t()` key. If the key does not exist, add it to all seven
locales; parity is test-enforced.

**RTL.** Any icon that points (arrows, chevrons, `ArrowRight`) is directional.
Use `rtl:rotate-180` or pick the icon from `dir`. Icons that do not point
(check, lock, key, alert) stay as they are. Spacing around icons uses `ms-*` /
`me-*`, never `ml-*` / `mr-*`.

**Language switcher:** the language name in its own script (`localeConfig.name`),
never a flag. A flag is a country and a language is not.

## 6. Prose stops at a component boundary

`.prose` is for article text written in MDX. It has no business inside an
embedded component, and until this pass it was inside all of them.

**The boundary is one of two things:**

| the component | what marks it |
| --- | --- |
| hydrated (`client:idle`) | `<astro-island>` — automatic, nothing to remember |
| rendered without a client directive | `class="not-prose"` on its outermost element |

The second row is not optional. A React component used from MDX without a
client directive renders to plain HTML with no island tag around it, so
`Callout` in `faq.mdx` sat in raw article prose. If you write or rewrite a
component that MDX can embed, put `not-prose` on its root. It costs nothing
when the component is also hydrated.

**Why two mechanisms and not just `not-prose`.** Because the leak had two
sources and they need different fixes.

1. The hand-written `.prose h1…h4 / p / ul / ol / li` rules in
   `src/styles/globals.css` are plain descendant selectors, specificity
   (0,1,1), emitted *after* `@tailwind utilities`. They beat every utility
   class, and they never honoured `not-prose` at all. Measured: `text-micro`
   (11px), `text-caption` (13px), `text-body-sm` (15px) and `text-h3` (21px)
   all rendered at 17px in all 13 islands on `/guides/what-is-nostr`. Each of
   those rules now carries the boundary guard:

   ```css
   :not(:where(astro-island *, [class~="not-prose"], [class~="not-prose"] *))
   ```

   Write it out at every new `.prose` rule. CSS has no selector variables; the
   same string lives as `NOT_IN_COMPONENT` in `tailwind.config.js`.

2. `@tailwindcss/typography`'s own rules are `:where()`-wrapped at (0,1,0), so
   a utility class already beats them — but only where a utility exists.
   Margins, list markers, `dd` padding, blockquote rules and `hr` have no
   utility on them in most components, so those leaked. Those rules *do*
   honour `not-prose`, and that guard survives an `<astro-island>` in between
   (it is `[class~="not-prose"] *`, a descendant combinator, not a child one).
   What it cannot do is know about a tag it has never heard of. So
   `globals.css` carries a **boundary reset** in `@layer components` that puts
   the Tailwind preflight baseline back inside islands.

**The reset's specificity is the whole trick.** It is `(0,1,0)`, the same as
the plugin's rules, but later in the components layer — so it wins over the
plugin, and a utility class in the utilities layer still wins over it. In
between, exactly. It also resets the boundary root to `1rem / 1.5 /
hsl(var(--foreground))`, because `.prose-lg` sets 18px on the `<article>` and
`<astro-island>` is `display: contents`, so the size inherits straight through.
A component now renders inside an article exactly as it renders anywhere else.

Dark mode needs a second pass at (0,2,0): the `invert` block compiles through
the `dark:` variant to `.dark\:prose-invert:is(.dark *) …`, which outranks a
plain utility. Every element-level key in that block carries the guard in its
own selector, which is why `invert` in `tailwind.config.js` is written with
computed keys.

**Code.** Inline code is `gray-800` on `gray-100`, inverted in dark. It used to
be `pink-600` / `pink-400`, and pink is not in the palette. Highlighted blocks
(`.astro-code`) get a `gray-50` ground and a `gray-200` border in light — they
were `#fff` on a white card, which is no block at all — and the `<code>` inside
them is explicitly stripped of the inline-code chip, or `prose-invert` gives
every line its own slab in dark mode.

## 7. Links, tables and code inside an article

Three rules that only bite inside `.prose`, all of them in `globals.css`.

**One link treatment.** A link in running text is `primary-text` (#7C3AED,
5.70:1 on white), `primary-400` in dark, underlined at 1px with a 2px offset,
thickening to 2px on hover. Nothing else. Before this there was no `a` rule at
all, so a markdown link fell through to the typography plugin's default and
rendered #111827 — near-black, which on gray-700 body ink reads as bold text
rather than a link — while the inline JSX links in the MDX each brought their
own colour. `/guides/quickstart` served seven treatments in one article.

The rule is `.prose a:not([class*="bg-"]):not($BOUNDARY)`. The attribute
selector is what lifts it to (0,2,1), high enough to beat a `text-blue-600`
written in a content file; it is also the exemption, because a link that
carries its own ground is a button and keeps its own colours.

**Tables scroll in their own box.** `src/components/guides/GuideTable.astro` is
registered as the lowercase `table` key in the `components` map that
`[slug].astro` hands to `<Content />`, so every markdown pipe table renders
inside a `.guide-table` wrapper. Do not "fix" this with `display: block;
overflow-x: auto` on the `<table>` — that drops the table role in assistive
technology. The wrapper is `tabindex="0"` because a region you can only scroll
with a mouse fails WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.1; the global `*:focus-visible` outline
covers it.

The affordance is the local/scroll scroll-shadow pair: two cover gradients at
`background-attachment: local` that travel with the content, two shadows at
`attachment: scroll` pinned to the box underneath. A shadow shows on exactly
the edges that still have table behind them, in either direction, with no
JavaScript. The margins live on the wrapper, not the table — inside the
overflow box they would put 32px of shadow past each end of the table.

A table written as literal JSX in an MDX file does **not** go through the map
(MDX only substitutes markdown-generated elements). The one in `quickstart.mdx`
carries `className="guide-table" tabIndex={0}` by hand. Any new one should too.

**Code is LTR, everywhere.** `pre, code, kbd, samp` carry
`direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: isolate`. On `/ar/` the `dir="rtl"` on `<html>`
put ASCII source in an RTL paragraph and the bidi algorithm tore the
punctuation off the ends: `  "names": {` laid out with the opening quote to the
right of the word and the colon and brace dropped on the left, `"alice":
"b0635…"` came out as `alice":"`, and inline `.well-known` rendered
`well-known.`. Isolation is what keeps an inline snippet in its right place
inside the Arabic line around it.

`.astro-code .line` then carries `unicode-bidi: plaintext`, which resolves each
line's direction from its own first strong character. That one is not
cosmetic: several Arabic guides use ` ```text ` blocks for short translated
dialogue, and the LTR paragraph direction above would otherwise strand the
trailing colon of `في حفلة:` on the wrong side.
