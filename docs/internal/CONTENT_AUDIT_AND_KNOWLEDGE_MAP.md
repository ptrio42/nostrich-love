## Guidelines for Future Guide Authors

### Content Creation Principles

#### 1. Always Start with the User
- What is their current state?
- What do they need to know?
- What will they do with this knowledge?
- Never explain without purpose

#### 2. Follow the Pedagogical Flow
```
Concept → Analogy → Example → Practice → Quiz
```
- Every guide should have a clear analogy
- Real examples beat abstract explanations
- Interactive practice reinforces learning
- Quizzes verify understanding

#### 3. Respect the Skill Level
- **Beginner:** No jargon, heavy analogies, visual aids
- **Intermediate:** Some technical terms, practical focus
- **Advanced:** Technical depth, assumes prior knowledge

#### 4. Internationalization is MANDATORY
- Never hardcode strings
- Use translation keys: `t('guide.section.topic')`
- Update all 4 locales: en, pl, es, de
- See I18N_PATTERNS.md for details

#### 5. Dark Mode Colors
- **AVOID:** `dark:bg-gray-900/50` (muddy brown)
- **USE:** `dark:bg-gray-900` (solid dark gray)

### Content Review Process

1. **Self-Review:** Author checks against guidelines
2. **Build Check:** Verify no build errors
3. **Pedagogical Review:** Does it teach effectively?
4. **Technical Review:** Is it accurate?
5. **I18n Review:** Are all strings translatable?

### Maximum Scope Limits

- **3 files per task** (guides + components + translations)
- **1 file at a time** when creating new content
- Break complex tasks into sequential small tasks
- Build after EVERY component creation or guide file

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| "Let me create 5 files at once" | Hard to verify, easy to miss errors | Create 1, verify, then next |
| Hardcoded strings | Breaks i18n | Use `t('key')` always |
| `/guides/name` links | Breaks locale routing | Use `/en/guides/name` |
| `dark:bg-gray-900/50` | Looks muddy | Use `dark:bg-gray-900` |
| No build verification | Errors accumulate | Build after every change |
| Skipping quiz translations | Incomplete i18n | Translate all 4 locales |
