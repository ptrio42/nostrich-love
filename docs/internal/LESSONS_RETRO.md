# Nostrich.love Project Retro

**Date:** March 11, 2026  
**Context:** Content strategy exploration for nostrich.love official account

---

## What I Learned

### 1. Feature Inventory != Feature Value

**Initial assumption:** More features = more value  
**Reality:** User explicitly said key generator, zap simulator, client recommender are "nothing special"

**Lesson:** Always validate which features users consider differentiators vs checkbox features. The impressive technical implementation doesn't matter if it's table stakes.

---

### 2. Hidden Complexity Reveals True Investment

**Discovery:** The Follow Pack Finder has 306KB of curated account data (300+ accounts across 16 categories)

**Why this matters:**
- This represents manual curation work (can't be automated)
- Shows long-term commitment to content quality
- 16 categories indicates broad audience targeting (not just Bitcoiners)

**Lesson:** Look for data volume and curation effort as signals of real value, not just UI polish.

---

### 3. The "Ghost Badge" Problem

**Discovery:** Badge system awards badges in localStorage but UI is hidden

**Implications:**
- Backend is ready, frontend is disabled
- Users earn achievements they can't see
- Creates technical debt (why track what you don't show?)

**Lesson:** Always check if a feature is actually user-visible before suggesting it in content. "Works in code" ≠ "Shipped to users"

---

### 4. Technical Architecture Reveals Philosophy

**Stack choices:**
- Astro (SSG) + React (islands) = Performance + interactivity
- localStorage only = Privacy-first, no tracking
- 4-language i18n = Genuine accessibility commitment
- No analytics = Principles over metrics

**Lesson:** The tech stack reflects values. The site aims to make Nostr accessible to beginners with different interests.

**Content implication:** Explain privacy and accessibility through tasks a beginner can complete.

---

### 5. Content Strategy Needs Voice Calibration

**Failed approaches:**
- Generic "check out this tool" posts
- Problem/solution frameworks
- Feature lists

**Successful direction:**
- Specific, concrete details (300+ accounts, 34 relays)
- "I discovered this" tone vs "we built this"
- Value-first (what users get) vs feature-first (what we built)

**Lesson:** The account is @nostrich.love (brand) not @yourname (personal). Posts should feel like discoveries worth sharing, not self-promotion.

---

### 6. Audience Definition Must Match the Project Brief

**Current rule in CLAUDE.md:** The site serves anyone new to Nostr, including people who read, converse, publish or explore the technology. The former creator-only rule was incorrect.

**Why this kept coming up:**
- A feature can support several beginner tasks
- Relay Playground can help curious readers see how relays work
- Follow Packs can help people find conversations on topics they care about

**Lesson:** Explain a feature through the task it helps a beginner complete. Do not make one occupation the default audience.

---

### 7. The Multi-Language Moat

**Discovery:** Full 4-language implementation (EN, PL, ES, DE)

**Why this is underrated:**
- Most Nostr resources are English-only
- Expands TAM (total addressable market) by ~3x
- Shows serious commitment (not MVP)

**Lesson:** Multi-language support is a genuine differentiator in the Nostr space. Worth highlighting even briefly.

---

### 8. Interactive ≠ Gamification

**Clarification needed:**
- Interactive = Users do things (simulators, quizzes, tools)
- Gamification = Points, badges, streaks, leaderboards

**Status:**
- Interactive elements: Fully active and valuable
- Gamification (badges): Disabled/hidden

**Lesson:** Don't conflate interaction with game mechanics. Interactive tools provide value; gamification adds engagement layer.

---

### 9. The Empty Feed Problem is Universal

**Discovery:** Both Empty Feed Fixer and Follow Pack Finder solve the same problem (new users see no content)

**But positioned differently:**
- Empty Feed Fixer = Quick onboarding (generic)
- Follow Pack Finder = Deep discovery (special)

**Lesson:** Same problem, different depth of solution = different value proposition. Don't lump them together.

---

### 10. Documentation Gaps Create Blind Spots

**What I couldn't find easily:**
- Clear feature flag system (badges hidden via commented code, not config)
- User analytics/metrics (intentionally absent)
- Content performance data

**Implications:**
- Hard to know what's actually used
- Content strategy based on assumptions
- Need qualitative feedback (user interviews)

**Lesson:** Technical exploration reveals implementation. User research reveals value. Need both.

---

## Content Strategy Recommendations

### For Large Account Shares

**Lead with concrete numbers:**
- "300+ curated accounts" (not "follow packs")
- "34 relays" (not "relay explorer")
- "16 guides in 4 languages" (not "comprehensive content")

**Frame as discovery:**
- "Found this..." vs "We built..."
- "Worth bookmarking" vs "Check out our site"

**Focus on beginner pain points:**
- Empty feeds → Follow Pack Finder
- Technical intimidation → Layman guides
- Finding community → Curated categories

### Post Cadence

**Daily content types:**
- Monday: Meme (relatability)
- Tuesday: Tool spotlight (Follow Pack, Relay Playground)
- Wednesday: Educational snippet (guide excerpt)
- Thursday: FAQ/glossary term
- Friday: Feature highlight
- Weekend: Cool Nostr project

**Weekly "value drop":**
- One comprehensive post highlighting the trifecta: Follow Packs + Relay Lab + Accessibility

---

## What I Got Wrong Initially

1. **Suggested badge system** without checking if it was visible to users
2. **Listed all features** without filtering for "special vs generic"
3. **Used problem/solution framework** which felt too sales-y
4. **Didn't clarify account voice** (brand vs personal) upfront

---

## Open Questions

1. **User behavior:** Which interactive tools get the most use?
2. **Traffic sources:** Where do current visitors come from?
3. **Conversion:** Do users complete guides? Share them?
4. **Community:** Any user-generated content or testimonials?
5. **Competitors:** What are learnnostr.org, nostr.how doing differently?

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document feature differentiation (LESSONS_FEATURES.md)
2. ✅ Create this retro (LESSONS_RETRO.md)
3. 🔄 Draft 7 daily posts for Week 1
4. 🔄 Define success metrics (engagement? traffic? guide completions?)
5. 🔄 Set up tracking (even simple UTM parameters)

---

*Key insight: The project has genuine differentiators (Follow Pack curation, Relay Playground interactivity, layman-friendly tone). Content should amplify these specific strengths, not list all features equally.*

## Influencer Content Analysis

**Date:** March 11, 2026  
**Purpose:** Document what major Nostr influencers (Gigi, ODELL, HODL) repost and why

### Who We Analyzed

**Gigi (@dergigi)** - The Philosophical Builder
- **Content style:** Long-form essays (2000-4000 words), philosophical, historical
- **Reposts:** Technical tutorials with practical utility, open-source contributions, resources lowering barriers to entry
- **Key insight:** Values academic rigor with accessible explanations

**ODELL** - The Actionable Pragmatist  
- **Content style:** Short-form threads + podcasts, direct, action-oriented
- **Reposts:** Security tools, "how to" content, honest tool reviews, community-driven projects
- **Key insight:** Prioritizes immediate utility and self-sovereignty

**HODL** - Community Focused
- **Reposts:** Long-term thinking, value-for-value content, anti-speculation messaging

### What They Repost (Common Patterns)

1. **Utility First** - Can someone use this immediately?
2. **Educational Depth** - Lowers barriers without condescending
3. **Open Source Ethos** - CC licenses, permissionless, no gatekeeping
4. **Honest Limitations** - What doesn't work, trade-offs admitted
5. **First-Person Experience** - "I tried this" not "this exists"
6. **No Sponsors/Ads** - Audience-funded only
7. **Technical Depth + Accessibility** - For both beginners (analogies) and experts (specifications)

### What They DON'T Repost

- Hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Vague claims ("best in class")
- Marketing speak ("join thousands of users")
- Clickbait ("you won't believe...")
- Ad-supported content
- Thread unrollers
- Cross-posted Twitter content without Nostr context

### Content Archetypes That Perform

1. **Build in Public Tutorial** - Step-by-step with actual commands (Gigi-style)
2. **Philosophical Manifesto** - Problem → Analysis → Vision (thesis-driven)
3. **Security Alert** - Urgent but actionable vulnerability disclosure (ODELL-style)
4. **Tool Discovery** - Honest review: pros, cons, verdict

### The Honesty Test

Before posting, ask: *Would this content still be valuable if the creator gained nothing from it?*
- Yes = Honest (repost-worthy)
- No = Marketing (repost-averse)

### Nostr-Native Content Signals

- Uses nostr: links (nevent, naddr, npub)
- References NIPs by number
- Includes lightning addresses for zaps
- Zap splits for multi-contributor rewards
- Timestamps by block height (Bitcoin culture)

### For nostrich.love Specifically

**High-Repost Potential Approaches:**

1. **"I Curated 300+ Accounts" Story**
   - First-person experience
   - Specific utility (16 categories)
   - Honest limitation ("export only works with some clients")

2. **"The Empty Feed Problem" Technical Deep Dive**
   - Problem: New users see nothing
   - Analysis: Why onboarding fails
   - Solution: Curated starter packs
   - Gigi-style educational depth

3. **Client Simulator Review**
   - Pros: Try before installing
   - Cons: Some lag, can't actually post
   - Verdict: Worth bookmarking anyway
   - ODELL-style honest tool review

**The Ultimate Repost Test:**
Would Gigi or ODELL share this?
- If yes: Publish
- If no: Rewrite until yes

### Key Takeaway

Repost-worthy content combines:
- **Philosophical depth** + **practical utility** + **open-source ethos**
- Delivered with **honesty about trade-offs**
- And **respect for reader's time and intelligence**

Avoid marketing speak. Embrace first-person experience. Admit limitations. Focus on utility.
