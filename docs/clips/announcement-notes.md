# Announcement notes (kind 1)

Drafts to post with the teaser. Pick one, edit it into your own voice — it goes
out under your key, so it should sound like you and not like a changelog.

Attach `out/nostrich-teaser-vertical.mp4`. The 3.4s language loop works better as
a reply or quote than as the lead.

**Re-run `capture-shots.sh` before posting.** The site changed materially in
August 2026 — the home page, the level badges and the progress UI all moved — so
any `out/` from before that is a teaser of a site that no longer exists.

## What actually distinguishes this site

Get this right before writing anything, because the obvious claim is false and a
Nostr audience will check.

**Not "seven languages."** nostr.how ships 11 complete locales, nstart 12. Saying
you are the multilingual one tells a reviewer you have not looked at your own
field.

**Not "the only one with RTL."** nostr.how ships Persian. Verified on their own
language switcher, August 2026.

**Arabic and Hindi.** `nostr.how/ar` and `/hi` are 404. nstart, nostr-wot,
usenostr and learnnostr have neither. Independently corroborated by
github.com/tyiu/nostr-localization-tracker, which records Arabic as *partial* in
Amethyst/Damus/Nos/Snort and Hindi only in Amethyst. This is the real gap.

**It is a course, not a page.** 16 guides across three levels, 13 of them ending
in a quiz that records what you got right, in all seven languages. No competing
onboarding site has quizzes at all. Nothing is locked — the levels are a reading
order, not gates.

The strongest sentence available is the intersection: *a structured beginner
course, with practice, in Arabic and Hindi.* Each part alone has competition. The
three together do not.

## A — the gap (recommended)

> If you have ever wanted to hand someone a Nostr guide in their own language and
> found there wasn't one, this is for the two cases where that is still true.
>
> nostrich.love now teaches Nostr as an actual course — 16 guides, three levels,
> most ending in a quiz — and it reads properly in Arabic and Hindi. Not a
> translated landing page: the whole thing, layout mirrored, quizzes included.
>
> Free, open source, no account needed.
>
> https://nostrich.love

Why this one: it names a gap the reader can verify in ninety seconds, and it
hands them something to *do* — pass it on — while asking nothing of them.

---

## B — short, for the reply-heavy crowd

> nostrich.love is a course now: 16 guides, three levels, quizzes at the end of
> most of them. Seven languages, including Arabic and Hindi — which almost
> nothing else in Nostr covers.
>
> Free, no account, open source. A link for the next person who asks you what
> this is.
>
> https://nostrich.love

---

## C — the builder's angle

> Spent a while turning nostrich.love from a pile of guides into a course.
>
> There were thirteen quizzes on the site and twelve of them recorded nothing at
> all — you could answer every question correctly and it knew only that you had
> opened some pages. Meanwhile a daily streak counter rewarded you for coming
> back to an onboarding site you are supposed to leave. Both fixed: the quizzes
> count, the streak is gone, and finishing a level means having read it and
> passed it.
>
> Free, open source: https://nostrich.love

Why you might not lead with this: it is about the repair rather than the reader.
Good as a follow-up or a reply to "what changed?", weaker as the opening post.

## D: learning as play (goes with the play cut), chosen from ptrio42's words

For the second video — see `walkthrough-cut.md`. **The note and the clip are one
post**: the note makes the "boring" claim, the clip is the evidence, so nothing
boring ever has to appear on screen.

> Reading a 2,500-word tutorial in one block is how you forget it by tomorrow.
> Instead, try the thing, then immediately check what stuck.
> That is how nostrich.love teaches Nostr.
> The right way is the fun way.
>
> Check out our guides at https://nostrich.love/guides

Final, 2026-08-13. An earlier, longer draft narrated what the clip shows and
listed the counts — cut deliberately. The facts it carried ("free · open source ·
no account · 7 languages") ride in the video's standing footer on every frame,
so the note does not repeat them, and the link lands on the guides hub rather
than the homepage because the hub is what the film just showed.

The "2,500-word tutorial" is the hook's rhetorical target, not a claim about
competitors by name — and do not invert it into "nothing here is long": the
site's median guide is ~1,240 words and `faq` is 3,462.

## Do not claim

Each of these is either false or unmeasured. They are listed because the first
two were in an earlier draft of this file.

- ❌ "the only multilingual Nostr guide" — nostr.how 11, nstart 12
- ❌ "the only one with full RTL" — nostr.how ships Persian
- ❌ "the first Polish Nostr resource" — nstart has Polish, nostr.com.pl exists.
  *First Polish course* is defensible; first resource is not.
- ❌ "translations reviewed by native speakers" — structure is verified, language
  quality is not, until a named person has checked ar/hi/zh
- ❌ any traffic or user number — there is no analytics readout behind one. The
  home page carried "Join thousands discovering…" for months on no evidence; it
  was removed for exactly this reason. Do not put it back in a post.
- ❌ anything about the key generator. It is a demonstration, deliberately kept
  out of the teaser: advertising "generate a Nostr identity here" contradicts
  what the site's own security guide tells people to do.
- ❌ **"no tracking"** — the site loads a third-party analytics beacon.
  `src/config/site.ts:32-35` enables it and `src/layouts/Layout.astro:149`
  injects `static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js`; it is in the built
  pages. "No account" is true — progress is `localStorage` only — but this
  audience reads view-source. Draft A carried "no tracking" until 2026-08-12.
- ❌ "unlocks the next guide", "locked", "gated". Nothing on the site is gated
  and its own explainer says "Nothing is graded and nothing is locked"
  (`GamificationExplainer.tsx:362`). Levels are a reading order.
- ❌ "certificate". Finishing a level is real, but what a reader sees is a badge
  modal saying "Beginner Level Complete" — there is no document, page or
  download. "Certificate" is internal vocabulary only.

## Notes on posting

Lead with what the reader gets, not with the release. "Just shipped" is a
developer's frame; "here is a link in their language" is the reader's.

If someone asks what changed under the hood, the honest short answer is: the
quizzes were decorative and now count, three different files disagreed about what
order the course was in, and the front page was selling a five-minute signup for
a site that is a course.

A sandstr teaser built from the same scripts may be going out around the same
time. Two identically-shaped videos from two accounts in one week reads as a
content mill — space them, or cut them differently.
