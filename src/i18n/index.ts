 * run after the strings are already in place, so today the event fires before
 * any subscriber exists and is effectively a no-op.
 *
 * Caveat for future lazy locale loading: `useTranslation`'s snapshot is the
 * URL-derived locale, so firing this event for an already-current locale will
 * NOT re-render mounted components (useSyncExternalStore skips re-render when
 * the snapshot is unchanged). If strings ever start arriving after mount,
 * add a version counter to the snapshot alongside the locale.
